# Here I try to explain what I'm doing!

I have at this point created three pages. One for displaying products, one for customers and one for making an order. I have been mixing them up a little but I think I'm heading in the right direction.

I later found it more reasonable to split it up into customer(s), order(s) and product(s) folders with subviews.
